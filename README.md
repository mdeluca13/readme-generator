# readme-generator

## Description

README Generator is a Node.JS program that creates a README.md file by taking user input for each section. As a web developer, you need to create README.md files constently, this program allows you to create the README.md file quickly through prompts. 

I was able to demonstrate what I have learned throughout the Carleton University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp as well as use my researching skills to find and complete this program.

## Installation

You will need to install [node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to run the README Generator. 

You will also have to run command in node.JS terminal >> npm install

## Usage

1. When you run node index.js in the node.JS terminal, this will initialize the program.
2. You will then be prompted with a series of questions to fill in your README.md file. 
3. Once you have answered all the questions, you will be see "Enjoy your README! in your node.JS terminal. 
4. You can then view your newly created README.md file.
